[Pi OS Simulator](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-1HGqj0Z99-pi-os-simulator) simulates a Raspberry Pi OS terminal environment, allowing users to practice and learn Linux commands interactively as if they were using a real Raspberry Pi. It responds to user inputs with terminal-style outputs, providing a realistic experience for learning and experimentation. The aim is to offer a beginner-friendly platform for users to explore and understand basic to intermediate Linux commands, focusing on the context of Raspberry Pi usage. Users can test commands, explore directories, manage files, and perform various operations typically done on a Raspberry Pi.

The custom GPT is designed to keep the learning process engaging and straightforward. While it primarily outputs command results, it can also guide users with step-by-step questions or explanations upon request. This approach helps users grasp Linux concepts gradually without feeling overwhelmed. The environment is ideal for those who are new to Raspberry Pi or Linux, providing a safe space to practice commands without the risk of affecting an actual system.
